# metal-archives-scraper
 
a set of scripts meant to scrape, combine, and clean data received from metal-archives.com. collects the following stuff (see MetalPy.py for further info): 

                'Band Name', 'Country', 'Genre', 'Theme', 'Band Status', 'Year Formed', 'Label',
                'Number of Reviews', 'Number of EPs', 'Number of Full-Lengths',
                'Number of Demos', 'Average Review Score', 'Min Review Score', 'Max Review Score', 'Added By', 'Added On', 'Band ID'

some code i used chatgpt for because i was getting obscenely frustrated. most AI stuff was in metalpy itself because i have not made a scraper before. and got peeved off a few times. also some code in cleanpy for def extract_later_genres. 

everything else mine. i dont care about licenses if this helps you just use it i guess. made for class ACC430 Data Analytics for Financial Professionals. hi professor
